Project Overview
RiskRushBot is a web application that predicts credit risk using machine learning and provides an engaging user experience through a chatbot interface. It leverages EDA to uncover data insights and logistic regression for accurate predictions, wrapped in a modern, animated design inspired by futuristic aesthetics.
Features

Credit Risk Prediction: Uses logistic regression to evaluate creditworthiness based on user inputs.
Interactive Chatbot: Suggests loan-related questions and provides detailed, unique responses.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes data distributions, correlations, and outliers for deeper insights.
Professional Design: Centered form layout with hover effects, Roboto font, and smooth animations.
Error Handling: Robust backend to manage invalid inputs and ensure a seamless experience.

Tech Stack

Backend: Flask, Python
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression), pandas, numpy
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Styling: Custom CSS with gradients, shadows, and animations
Data Analysis: Matplotlib, seaborn (for EDA)

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/ad1lhasan/RiskRushBot.git
cd RiskRushBot


Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Ensure Model File:

Place your trained model.pkl (RandomForest model) in the project root.
If you donâ€™t have one, train it using the provided train_model.py (see Model Details).



Usage

Run the Flask App:
python app.py


Access the App:

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Fill out the credit risk form to get a prediction.
Interact with the chatbot for loan-related insights.


View Results:

Predictions are displayed on a dedicated result page.
Chatbot responses appear in a sleek, animated sidebar.

Model Details

Algorithm: RandomForest
Features: Numerical and categorical inputs (customize based on your dataset, e.g., Income, Credit_Score).
Training:
Run train_model.py to generate model.pkl using your dataset.
Example dataset: Kaggleâ€™s loan data (merge on 'ID' column, as discussed).
Includes EDA for data cleaning, visualization, and outlier removal.



To train a new model:
python train_model.py
